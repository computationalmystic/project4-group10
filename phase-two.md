## Phase Two
1. Clone your project repository in computationalmystic on GitHub. For example: https://github.com/computationalmystic/project4-group17 would be the repository for group 17 on this project, if there was a group 17. Your group will be between 1 and 16. Groups are listed on Canvas. These are different groups than your last project, and you should already know that.
2. Create a "production" and "test" branch for your repository. 
3. Change the default branch from "master" to "production"
4. Have each member of your team create their own branch
5. Each member of the team should perform the following steps in their branch
    - Create a "to do list" for writing code to implement the design document you turned in for the last assignment. It should be comprehensive, listing each class and method that should be created. 
    - Name your document 'lastname-teamnumber.md'. Mine would be goggins-17.md in that example. 
    - Use headings to organize subsets of work 
    - Put a copy of the team design document you are using, or a link to it, at the top of your file
6. When you have finished with your branch, issue a pull request and have one of your team mates merge it. 
7. Together, build a final document called 'overview.md', which includes the following: 
    - List of core objects that seem consistent across all of your designs/documents/to-dos
    - A short 3-5 sentence description of what your next steps would be if you were building this project as a team.
